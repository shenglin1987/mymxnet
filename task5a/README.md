#End-to-end deep learning methods for Task5a of BioASQ.

The codes include data processing, model training (forward nn with average embedding w2v as input, lstm, gru) and result prediction. Bidirectional lstm is now under construction. All methods could be stacked into deep. Will submit the contest results soon. More details can be found in http://participants-area.bioasq.org/general_information/Task5a/
